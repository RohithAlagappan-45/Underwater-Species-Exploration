Underwater-Species-Exploration

ABSTRACT: 
Underwater species exploration using deep learning technology is designed to classify underwater species from images and retrieve key details such as their biological name, extinction status, and geographic origin. The system employs advanced convolutional neural networks (CNN) for accurate image classification. A well-organized dataset of underwater species is used to train, validate, and test the model, ensuring robustness. The project integrates a backend system with a REST API to connect the model and a database storing species information. A user-friendly frontend allows seamless image upload from system or image link and instant results display.

OBJECTIVE: 
•	To automatically recognize and classify marine species from images.
•	To retrieve the information about each species, including its biological name, Extinction status, and its geographic origin.
•	To support environmental monitoring by identifying endangered or invasive species and their distribution in specific regions.
•	To identify various species in various regions of ocean.

SOCIAL IMPACT:
•	To automatically recognize and classify marine species from images, making species identification accessible to a wider audience.
•	To raise public awareness about marine biodiversity and promote environmental education by providing detailed information about species.
•	To contribute to sustainable fishing practices and help maintain ecological balance, benefiting coastal communities that depend on marine resources.
